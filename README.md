# Spark for Git commits

This is an old assignment for a course on Big Data Processing at the TU Delft. 
Below are the assignment instructions, my solution can be found within the src folder.

---

### IMPORTANT
Make sure that in | File | Project Structure | Modules the language level is set to 8, as Spark/Scala is not compatible 
with Java versions higher than 8.

### Setup of the assignment

1. [Spark and RDD's](<src/main/scala/RDDAssignment/readme.md>)
    In this part you will focus on the basics of Spark RDDs.
     
2. [Spark and DataFrames](<src/main/scala/DataFrameAssignment/readme.md>)
    In this part you will focus on the basics of Sparks SQL, and Spark Catalyst.


### About Spark.
In the lectures you learned about Spark and its core components. It is intended to process large
data volumes in a distributed fashion. Although a single laptop (most of you) will use, and the 
data set that will be used in the assignments match neither of these, you can still get the 
underlying Big Data Processing.
